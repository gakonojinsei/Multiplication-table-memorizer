# ðŸ”¢ Multiplication Table Trainer

## Features

- Custom range practice for both numbers
- Input validation and error handling
- Session statistics with accuracy tracking
- Simple interface
- Type 'q' anytime to quit

## Quick Start

```bash
python main.py
```

1. Set your practice ranges (min/max for each number)
2. Answer the multiplication questions
3. Type 'q' anytime to quit

## How it works

The program asks for 4 numbers to set your practice ranges:
1. First number minimum (e.g., 1)
2. First number maximum (e.g., 12)
3. Second number minimum (e.g., 1)
4. Second number maximum (e.g., 10)

Then it generates random questions like `7 Ã— 4 = ?` within those ranges.

## Testing

```bash
python test_main.py
```
